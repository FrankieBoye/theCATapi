## Introduction

I have been set the following challenge:

1. Sign up and create an API key at https://thecatapi.com/

2. Create an app that retrieves some data from one of the cat API endpoints (of your choice) and renders it on a web page. (Be creative!)

3. Send us a link to a GitHub repo where we can view the code you've written. The root folder of the repo should contain a screenshot showing your app rendering the cat data.

## Getting Started

```bash
> git@github.com:FrankieBoye/theCATapi.git
> copy the full path for index.html
> paste paste in your browser
> click on 'I NEED A CAT'
```

## Usage

This is a simple JavaScript/HTML web app that will display random cat pictures. It is a work in progress as I am not sure what direction to take with this yet.

## User stories

```
As a cat enthusiast, I would like to see some data from one of the cat API endpoints rendered on a web page.
