## Introduction

I have been set the following challenge:

1. Sign up and create an API key at https://thecatapi.com/

2. Create an app that retrieves some data from one of the cat API endpoints (of your choice) and renders it on a web page. (Be creative!)

3. Send us a link to a GitHub repo where we can view the code you've written. The root folder of the repo should contain a screenshot showing your app rendering the cat data.

## Getting Started

```
> clone git@github.com:FrankieBoye/theCATapi.git
> copy full path of index.html
> paste path into your browser address bar
> click button labelled 'CLICK FOR CAT!!'

You may require an API key. Head over to https://thecatapi.com and get one for free.

Pass the API key as a query parameter in index.js, eg e.g. https://thecatapi.com/v1/images?api_key=ABC123
```

## Usage

This is a simple JavaScript/HTML web app that will display random cat pictures and GIFs at the press of a button.

## User stories

```
As a cat enthusiast, I would like to be able to see random cat photos.

Added a header and some CSS styling for the background and button.
